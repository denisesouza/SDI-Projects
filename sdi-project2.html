    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>I have no included into my morning dog routine feeding all 5 of my dogs and the amount of
  time it takes me to feed each one.  I chose this theme as this process is part of my
  everyday routine. Every morning I wake up and if the dogs needs to be let outside,
  I will let them out. In order to work with what is required I have added buying dog food
  if needed into the process. If they need fresh water I will make sure they all get fresh water.

</p>
<p>The elements I have chosen are my dogs, their names, feeding time for each dog,
  the amount and type of dry food and the amount and type of wet food,
  as well as if they have to go outside and if they have fresh water.</p>
