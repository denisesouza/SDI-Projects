<p>My morning dog routine consists of letting the dog out and feeding her.
  I chose this theme as this process is part of my everyday routine. Every morning
  I wake up and if the dog needs to be let outside, I will let her out.
  While she is out I will prepare her food and make sure she has fresh water.
   If she does not have fresh water I will fill her bowl with fresh water.
   I also have to make sure there is enough food to feed her at least 2 cups of
   dry food and if not I will have to feed her 1 can of wet food. If she had to
   go out before I started making her food I will let her back in after I have
   prepared her food.</p>
<p>The elements I have chosen are my dog, her dry food, her wet food,
  the amount and type of dry food and the amount and type of wet food,
  as well as if she has to go outside and if she has fresh water.</p>
